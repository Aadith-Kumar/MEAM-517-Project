Node: Guys, set up a git ignore file to ignore all the build/ , log/ and install/ folders as we would want to build them in our own system and do not want other build executables pushed to the git!

When you pull the repo you will have the gitignore_sample file. Just rename it to .gitignore to the workspace root dir!
